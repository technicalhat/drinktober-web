      <description>Day counts on fingers 12, almost 13!! And I’m surprisingly ok, barring the odd “oh I could have a glass of&amp;hellip;.never mind” thoughts I’m alright! I’m tired, but less tired than usual. This is the first year I’ve not been tearing my hair out by week 2, I’m shocked how well I’m doing!? Someone have a party and tempt me to make it harder, I’m sick of grouting things!</description>

      <description>I am back! Didn’t post yesterday because I managed to lock myself out of the website: something that’s a common occurrence when drunk but I’m not sure how I managed it sober.
10 whole days in and I’ve lost 10lbs which is rather nice. Can’t say I’ve saved money because my house is falling down but still, I’ll take it! Today as oppose to my usual leisurely walk to the pub (the extent of my normal walking) I went on an actual solo wander which ended up being quite a treck through a housing estate, a tiny forest, some nice hills and some ropey garages.</description>

      <description>I really fancy a booze tbh. I’ve had a bastardo of a day, I’ve not stopped and I’m still on the grouting mission so everything hurts and I would put my face through a window for a little vat of wine. I could drink it in the bath when I look at my grout.
send help.</description>

      <title>A worrying development </title>

      <description>Today’s the first day I fancied a drink, which had led to a somewhat worrying development.
To keep me occupied, I have now replaced having a relaxing glass of wine with DIY. Today we have had a light fitted, ripped down a ceiling and it’s now 11pm and I’m removing all the grout from the bathroom tiles.
Is this healthy? Where will this end?
Will we survive?!!!!
Also my feet hurt, my hand is black And I have a significant amount of plaster in my hair and tit region.</description>

      <title>Well that was a challenge </title>

      <description>I’ve survived a challenge!
Most of you people know I’m a little&amp;hellip;.. funny. I’m quite OCD and if things aren’t right or tidy, expect a breakdown. I’m also an emotional drinker: annoyed? Have a brandy. Happy? Have a champers. Stressed? Vat of wine and an absolut chaser.
So yesterday I didn’t manage a post, but I did have half my kitchen ceiling down fixing a leaking lead pipe, plaster all over, half my bathroom taken out and no electric due to my dodge lighting.</description>
