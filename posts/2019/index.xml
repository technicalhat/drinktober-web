      <description>So there we have it, folks. Another year of #Drinktober comes to a close, and we absolutely smashed it this time around.
Donations are currently sitting at 110% of the fundraising target, Heidi&amp;rsquo;s swanned off to Tenerife to drink her body weight in Prosecco, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to sign off until we come back even bigger and better for Drinktober 2020!

      <description>Well, it’s done!! And what a bloody month. Here’s what I learned:
I don’t need alcohol, but I DO have the most stressful life and I don’t take enough time out. The past 2 weeks at work were hard. Not having a drink made me realise my job can be emotionally draining. I have little time for myself and I take on too much without thinking about unwinding in a better way.</description>

      <description>She’s back!!! Due to a short break, mainly consisting of the website not letting me log on, a bout of horrendous flu which killed me completely for a week and my job being ridiculously full on for several days which consumed my life&amp;hellip;.. I am back!!
Just in time for the end to be in sight! Thank you to everyone who has donated so far, this has certainly been a journey to this point 😂</description>

      <description>I don’t have anything exciting to say. I’ve just accepted drinking water is my life now&amp;hellip;. made a vegan sausage casserole for tomorrow nights dinner and made very nice dumplings to chuck in. Of course housemate then reminds me that they have beef dripping in, so I can’t have them. Chuffing excellent. Fml.

      <description>Today I had a late meeting again, so popped to the pub for the ultimate test. I was gaggingggggg for a drink. Any drink. Wine. Gin. Terps. I fancied one.
The batman (I meant barman but autocorrect knows best) recommended an Alcohol Free Kopperberg. “It’s just like the real thing! You can’t even tell the difference!” I was assured. Not a cider drinker but I thought give it a bash.</description>

      <description>For the 6th of #Drinktober, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d have a nice quite drink in the village. Unluckily for me, my plans were disrupted by the arrival of this Mad Goose!</description>

      <description>I’ve realised that this site has become more my rambling blog than anything so I’ll keep it brief today! 90’s Carrie Bradshaw narration isn’t a good look for me.
Still alcohol free and I’ve developed a new love for good old water. Managed to stay off the quorn today and had a nice Sunday dinner feat. nut roast. I have however replaced my wine habit with a spending habit: I’ve bought a painting, another lamp, a hat, a magnetic eyelash set, a kaftan, a pigeon pin badge and a gift for the missus already this weekend (the last ones a secret.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve got a pussy!
I have a dick-ah!
So what&amp;rsquo;s the problem?
Let&amp;rsquo;s do it quiiiiick
Pulling out all the stops for the 5th of #Drinktober, for this Rammsteiner Pilsner I actually went on tour with Rammstein and they let me ride their giant cock cannon, as you can see in the totally real and definitely not at all photoshopped picture below.</description>

      <description>Habits are funny aren’t they! 5 days in and I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve thought “oh I’ll just grab a coke” or wandered aimlessly to the wine aisle and spent £15 before I’ve even thought about if I actually want it!
Today was chilled with the wife and I’ve smashed in a decent homemade Quorn Lasagne. I now own 48% shares in Quorn FYI. My skin is also looking much brighter, although I do smash a load of acid on my face every night because 30’s, so it could also be that.</description>

      <description>Today is slightly better! Purchased some iron tablets: turned out that’s what fucked me up yesterday. An iron tablet and a multivit and I’m off.
I went out for work drinks this evening and had (drum roll please!) a J20 and a virgin cocktail&amp;hellip;. Which was nice but called ‘the love island’ so minus 3 points. I also spent a hideous amount on experimental quorn and nutroasts in Lidl. I’m currently sipping cranberry juice out of a wine glass so I can express my inner Friday Heidi.</description>

      <description>Well today has kicked my arse. I’ve felt absolutely crap all day: not sure if it’s lack of meat or caffeine. Shit day, sat in a meeting until 10.30 surrounded by wine and burgers&amp;hellip;. kill me now. I also had my first Ribena. What a load of shit.</description>

And you know we always will
It&amp;rsquo;s a bomber! It&amp;rsquo;s a bomber!
A Lancaster bomber - for the 2nd of #Drinktober I&amp;rsquo;ve got this rather tasty amber ale, even if it is named for the dark lands on the Wrong side of the Pennines&amp;hellip;</description>
