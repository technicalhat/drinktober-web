      <description>For the fourth beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman gave to me - Evil Elf biscuity ale, from Rudgate.
 He sees you when you&amp;rsquo;re sleeping
He&amp;rsquo;s watching from his shelf
He wants to cut you inside out
So beware the Evil Elf!
 Yes, here to spread a little Christmas fear, it&amp;rsquo;s the evil elf. He&amp;rsquo;s off the shelf, off the chain, and out for blood.</description>

      <description>For the third beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman gave to me - Anchor Christmas Ale!
And so, from the Department of Shameless prop re-use, here&amp;rsquo;s a Christmas Anchor.
Yo-Ho-Ho-Ho!</description>

      <description>For the second beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman gave to me, a Bad Elf dry hop ale.
So it looks like I was one present short yesterday, and now I know why! I found this cheeky little character sitting on his shelf&amp;hellip; and he&amp;rsquo;s nicked my beer!
That&amp;rsquo;s what I call a Bad Elf!</description>

      <description>For the first beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman gave to me, a White Christmas ale from Saltaire brewery.
There may not be snow on the ground, but Tony Montana here has his own ideas about how to enjoy a white Christmas&amp;hellip;
Merry Christmas, ya cock-a-roaches!</description>

      <description>Well, here we are again, back between the bottle and the glue gun for a festive Drinktober special edition.
When Heidi&amp;rsquo;s not engaged in alcohol free antics, she also rules over Hull LGBT+ Community Pride, AKA Pride in Hull with her tiny iron fist - or something along those lines anyway! So when she mentioned raising funds for their 2021 event I jumped at the opportunity to drink beer and show off :)</description>
