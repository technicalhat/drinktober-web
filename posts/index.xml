      <description>I like a southern comfort or a brandy on the rocks, even a cheeky gin ting too. Yesterday I was on different rocks!
Apparently when I don’t spend my sundays in the pub or cleaning, I enjoy outdoors now. Even getting muddy and climbing up waterfalls, j loved it! I’m even considering buying walking boots, what’s that all about? The none drinking has helped me go out and explore and actually move which I am enjoying.</description>

      <description>Only 7 days to go!! It feels like it’s gone super fast this year. On the theme of 7’s&amp;hellip;.. I lost another 7lbs this week, so celebrated by going for a 7 mile walk. And it RAINNNNNED. I got piss wet through, but persevered, like I have with my sober challenge!</description>

      <title>Where’s October? </title>

      <description>Where the hell has October gone?! A week and a day to go until normality can resume. Today was manic and I didn’t atop, but I didn’t actually think about having a drink, even though I had a night to myself when I’d usually treat myself. That’s personal growth right there lads!
We’ve not had many donations this year, despite Johnny making it the highest class DrinkTober yet. So thank you to those that have donated, and the rest of you get your hands in your pockets!</description>

      <description>There are a lot of names for what I do. Monster. Maniac. Serial killer.
All I know is, if you find yourself strapped to my table, the world would be a better place without you.
So what does that make me? Am I an avenging angel? The hero this city deserves? Or just another American Psycho?</description>

      <description>The ultimate challenge has occurred: had a meeting in the pub tonight after work. But, I stayed strong; and had 2 diet cokes! Which weirdly are more expensive than a pint, but hey ho still cheaper than moet.
I also resisted fish and chips, my only greater love than wine, so I’m chuffed I managed that despite being up at 6 with my dad been taken to a&amp;amp;e and work all day.</description>

      <description>Sooooooo tired and I have no energy! Went to give blood Today and it’s the first time it’s not been a great excuse to get drunk quicker! Overall I’m feeling better not drinking but I’m struggling to stay awake tonight: I reckon one vodka would currently knock me out anyway so I guess Viva le Sober!
Also on the subject of unconventional tattoos&amp;hellip;. I’ve booked one with all the money I saved not drinking 😂</description>

      <description>Hola! Works been stressful and last night I struggled a lot to not drink.
Butttttt, today I got weighed and I’ve lost 6lbs, taking my total to 16lbs which made me feel better! Went walking and managed 8.2 miles today, meaning I don’t fancy a drink at all tonight!
Please take a moment to donate if you can, my legs might drop off from today’s wandering so a cheeky fiver whilst I’m infirm would be 👌</description>

      <description>Jesus Christ I wanted a drink tonight!! I could on practically taste it. I spent a moment gazing at the prosecco at my corner shop waving my bank card and probably looked a bit not ok.
Frustrating day of stupid Expensive internet Dropping out and losing my work, followed by a 2 hour rowing with a smart plug which wouldn’t work and I would probably kill your nan for a drink about now.</description>

      <description>Well, that was a few days. Sent to work from home because I’ve developed a bizarre hives like rash type affair EVERYWHERE&amp;hellip;.. which apparently is a covid sign. Also, I’ve developed random sporadic vomiting today, WITHOUT EVEN HAVING AN ALCOHOL. Wtf?!!
So I am currently very itchy, a bit nauseous, and with a headache from 11 and a half hours on zoom meeting, and a little drink would be bloody fantastic.</description>
