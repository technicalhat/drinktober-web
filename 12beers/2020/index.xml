      <description>For the eleventh beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman brought to me : Blitzen Ruby Christmas Ale from Black Sheep
We&amp;rsquo;re almost at the end now, so it seems like a good time to celebrate with this famous festive special from the kebab shop - DÃ¶ner and Blitzen :D</description>

      <description>For the tenth day of Drinkmas, the Beerman brought to me : My Little Sabrony from Arbor Ales
It&amp;rsquo;s been a tough old year, a bit of a &amp;lsquo;mare. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s tricky to stay stable. A little horsing around once in a while can help save you from _foal_ing apart at the seams.
If you&amp;rsquo;re still reading after those dreadful horse puns, why not hoof it over to the donation page and drop a few quid in the box?</description>

      <description>For the ninth beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman brought to me : Pricky Back Otchan from Great Newsome Brewery
According to the label, the Pricky Back Otchan is the old Yorkshire name for a hedgehog, so naturally I had to bring out superstar hedgehog Princess Neville to take her turn in the spotlight.</description>

      <description>For the eighth beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman brought to me : Off Tempo Milkshake IPA from Bad Co. brewing
Normally this milkshake IPA would bring all the boys to the yard, but due to social distancing it&amp;rsquo;s running online milkshake classes instead.
A shiny no-prize goes to the first person to identify all the &amp;ldquo;boys&amp;rdquo; on the zoom call&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>For the seventh beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman brought to me : Easy Now Baby NEIPA from Bad Co. Brewing
It&amp;rsquo;s the eighth day of Drinkmas - New Beer&amp;rsquo;s Eve - and I&amp;rsquo;m stretching the theme to it&amp;rsquo;s limits in a flagrant case of wanting an excuse to make a costume. Baby IPA, Baby Yoda - close enough, right!
Guest starring Selwyn as the not very convincing Grogu in an undersized cardboard pod.</description>

      <description>For the sixth beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman brought to me : Christmas Kitty vanilla porter from Brass Castle
That&amp;rsquo;s right, the Christmas Kitty has come to visit - that well known festive tradition that we all know about. Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a deleted scene from the Cats movie?
Either way - meow!</description>

      <description>For the fifth beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman brought to me : Jingle Bell Rock golden ale from Pennine Brewing Co.
So occasionally when people see the Beercave Christmas decorations they ask &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s with the large paper boulder with the bells glued to it?&amp;rdquo;
So I tell them : &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s the Jingle Bell Rock!&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>For the fourth beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman gave to me - Evil Elf biscuity ale, from Rudgate.
 He sees you when you&amp;rsquo;re sleeping
He&amp;rsquo;s watching from his shelf
He wants to cut you inside out
So beware the Evil Elf!
 Yes, here to spread a little Christmas fear, it&amp;rsquo;s the evil elf. He&amp;rsquo;s off the shelf, off the chain, and out for blood.</description>

      <description>For the third beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman gave to me - Anchor Christmas Ale!
And so, from the Department of Shameless prop re-use, here&amp;rsquo;s a Christmas Anchor.
Yo-Ho-Ho-Ho!</description>

      <description>For the second beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman gave to me, a Bad Elf dry hop ale.
So it looks like I was one present short yesterday, and now I know why! I found this cheeky little character sitting on his shelf&amp;hellip; and he&amp;rsquo;s nicked my beer!
That&amp;rsquo;s what I call a Bad Elf!</description>

      <description>For the first beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman gave to me, a White Christmas ale from Saltaire brewery.
There may not be snow on the ground, but Tony Montana here has his own ideas about how to enjoy a white Christmas&amp;hellip;
Merry Christmas, ya cock-a-roaches!</description>

      <description>Well, here we are again, back between the bottle and the glue gun for a festive Drinktober special edition.
When Heidi&amp;rsquo;s not engaged in alcohol free antics, she also rules over Hull LGBT+ Community Pride, AKA Pride in Hull with her tiny iron fist - or something along those lines anyway! So when she mentioned raising funds for their 2021 event I jumped at the opportunity to drink beer and show off :)</description>
