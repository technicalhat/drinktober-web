      <description>So, that&amp;rsquo;s about it for Drinktober 2020 then. I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you guys, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of fun. I&amp;rsquo;m already starting to plot next year&amp;rsquo;s antics, I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to pull out quite a few stops if I want to top this one!
As always, the donation site will be open for a while yet, so if you&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to chuck something in the pot and haven&amp;rsquo;t got around to it yet there&amp;rsquo;s still time.</description>

      <description>IT üëè IS üëè DONE üëè
I waited until 12 to have a prosecco&amp;hellip;..but after 2 glasses I‚Äôm done, I don‚Äôt even want to get lashed!
Possibly the weirdest DrinkTober yet, with covid and a new lockdown as of today, but I‚Äôm actually feeling quite good. This is the year I‚Äôve actually enjoyed the break and felt more comfortable to not drink. Im proud of myself and feeling quite grown up.</description>

      <description>And so at last we come to the final night of Drinktober 2020. It&amp;rsquo;s Drinkowe&amp;rsquo;en - the drunkest, spookiest night of the year!
I hope you&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed my ridiculous antics all month - we&amp;rsquo;re still a long way from the target so if you&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about making a donation now&amp;rsquo;s the time to hit that link over there, right under Heidi.
As for me, I&amp;rsquo;m going to enjoy a nice quiet drink outdoors - in the Garden of Death!</description>

      <description>Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s Satanic encounter left quite an impression on me.
Now that I&amp;rsquo;m in league with the forces of evil, I&amp;rsquo;ve retreated to Ye Olde Wizarding Shoppe where I&amp;rsquo;ve been dabbling in the Dart Arts.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs so bloody close!!
one more day to go. I was initially not looking forward to this October, but I‚Äôve surprisingly enjoyed it in a funny way. Covid times are weird, so getting out walking and away from boredom drinking In front of the telly has been great (Although no walking for me for a few days due to getting a massive tattoo on my foot Yesterday!)
Overall I‚Äôm looking forward to a little drink when I finish, but I‚Äôm proud of myself.</description>

      <description>Tonight finds me working on a &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; batch of homebrew for Drinkowe&amp;rsquo;en - this terrifying concoction was made under the influence of dark forces beyond my control.
It&amp;rsquo;s not my fault - the Devil made me brew it!</description>

      <description>What more can I say about the ghastly skeletal presence that&amp;rsquo;s appeared to host tonight&amp;rsquo;s thrilling episode?
With that massive ivory bonce, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear he&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a Bonehead!</description>

      <description>I like a southern comfort or a brandy on the rocks, even a cheeky gin ting too. Yesterday I was on different rocks!
Apparently when I don‚Äôt spend my sundays in the pub or cleaning, I enjoy outdoors now. Even getting muddy and climbing up waterfalls, j loved it! I‚Äôm even considering buying walking boots, what‚Äôs that all about? The none drinking has helped me go out and explore and actually move which I am enjoying.</description>

      <description>The mad science continues in tonight&amp;rsquo;s instalment, as I test out my new Synaptic Transmission device.
Can the machine transfer my mind and bring the construct to life? We&amp;rsquo;ll just have to wait and see&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Only 7 days to go!! It feels like it‚Äôs gone super fast this year. On the theme of 7‚Äôs&amp;hellip;.. I lost another 7lbs this week, so celebrated by going for a 7 mile walk. And it RAINNNNNED. I got piss wet through, but persevered, like I have with my sober challenge!</description>

      <description>Tonight sees me back in the lab and testing out my latest invention - this handy, compact anti-gravity machine, which is definitely a brand new invention and not the dream machine with a new label hastily taped to the front!
As you can see, things got away from me during the first test - my beer drifted away, torn from my hands by the Wild Gravity!
It&amp;rsquo;s true what they say- gravity is a harsh mistress!</description>

      <description>Where the hell has October gone?! A week and a day to go until normality can resume. Today was manic and I didn‚Äôt atop, but I didn‚Äôt actually think about having a drink, even though I had a night to myself when I‚Äôd usually treat myself. That‚Äôs personal growth right there lads!
We‚Äôve not had many donations this year, despite Johnny making it the highest class DrinkTober yet. So thank you to those that have donated, and the rest of you get your hands in your pockets!</description>

      <description>There are a lot of names for what I do. Monster. Maniac. Serial killer.
All I know is, if you find yourself strapped to my table, the world would be a better place without you.
So what does that make me? Am I an avenging angel? The hero this city deserves? Or just another American Psycho?</description>

      <description>Some smoked beer really demands some smoked food to go with it, so I fired up the BBQ in the midst of October in East Yorkshire (hey, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t raining! perfect weather!) with some homemade sausage and a chicken. Very tasty it was too!</description>

      <description>The ultimate challenge has occurred: had a meeting in the pub tonight after work. But, I stayed strong; and had 2 diet cokes! Which weirdly are more expensive than a pint, but hey ho still cheaper than moet.
I also resisted fish and chips, my only greater love than wine, so I‚Äôm chuffed I managed that despite being up at 6 with my dad been taken to a&amp;amp;e and work all day.</description>

      <description>Sooooooo tired and I have no energy! Went to give blood Today and it‚Äôs the first time it‚Äôs not been a great excuse to get drunk quicker! Overall I‚Äôm feeling better not drinking but I‚Äôm struggling to stay awake tonight: I reckon one vodka would currently knock me out anyway so I guess Viva le Sober!
Also on the subject of unconventional tattoos&amp;hellip;. I‚Äôve booked one with all the money I saved not drinking üòÇ</description>

      <description>What better way to celebrate the best Drinktober yet than with some commemorative body art?
I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think maybe the &amp;ldquo;Ink and Dagger Tattoo Parlour&amp;rdquo; might not have been the best choice though&amp;hellip;</description>

Please take a moment to donate if you can, my legs might drop off from today‚Äôs wandering so a cheeky fiver whilst I‚Äôm infirm would be üëå</description>

      <description>Jesus Christ I wanted a drink tonight!! I could on practically taste it. I spent a moment gazing at the prosecco at my corner shop waving my bank card and probably looked a bit not ok.
Frustrating day of stupid Expensive internet Dropping out and losing my work, followed by a 2 hour rowing with a smart plug which wouldn‚Äôt work and I would probably kill your nan for a drink about now.</description>

      <description>Well, that was a few days. Sent to work from home because I‚Äôve developed a bizarre hives like rash type affair EVERYWHERE&amp;hellip;.. which apparently is a covid sign. Also, I‚Äôve developed random sporadic vomiting today, WITHOUT EVEN HAVING AN ALCOHOL. Wtf?!!
So I am currently very itchy, a bit nauseous, and with a headache from 11 and a half hours on zoom meeting, and a little drink would be bloody fantastic.</description>

Drink! Drink! Drink! Till you drink no more!
Ravenage - More beer
Almost 2 weeks into Drinktober and it&amp;rsquo;s been quite a ride so far. As you can see, all this beer is starting to take it&amp;rsquo;s toll, so there&amp;rsquo;s only one thing that can fix it&amp;hellip;

      <description>Day counts on fingers 12, almost 13!! And I‚Äôm surprisingly ok, barring the odd ‚Äúoh I could have a glass of&amp;hellip;.never mind‚Äù thoughts I‚Äôm alright! I‚Äôm tired, but less tired than usual. This is the first year I‚Äôve not been tearing my hair out by week 2, I‚Äôm shocked how well I‚Äôm doing!? Someone have a party and tempt me to make it harder, I‚Äôm sick of grouting things!</description>

      <description>My name is Citrus Maxima. Commander of the armies of the Hops. General of the zesty Legions, loyal servant of the brew Emperor.
Drinker of a finished pint, holder of an empty glass.
And I will have my beer, in this pub or the next!
Stepping back in time for the 10th of Drinktober, to the days of Ancient Rome, where the mighty gladiator Citrus Maxima conquered the arena and toppled an empire.</description>

      <description>I am back! Didn‚Äôt post yesterday because I managed to lock myself out of the website: something that‚Äôs a common occurrence when drunk but I‚Äôm not sure how I managed it sober.
10 whole days in and I‚Äôve lost 10lbs which is rather nice. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve saved money because my house is falling down but still, I‚Äôll take it! Today as oppose to my usual leisurely walk to the pub (the extent of my normal walking) I went on an actual solo wander which ended up being quite a treck through a housing estate, a tiny forest, some nice hills and some ropey garages.</description>

Sat alone, with no cards, playing solitaire
Breathe cold air, fuel&amp;rsquo;s spent yeah

Space Dementia, Evil Scarecrow
I&amp;rsquo;ve been blasted into the deep space for the 9th of Drinktober, courtesy of Arbor Ales&amp;rsquo; Space Hardware.
I think the isolation has sent me a bit funny - am I really seeing Neville the space hedgehog or has my mind succumbed to Space Dementia?</description>

      <description>I really fancy a booze tbh. I‚Äôve had a bastardo of a day, I‚Äôve not stopped and I‚Äôm still on the grouting mission so everything hurts and I would put my face through a window for a little vat of wine. I could drink it in the bath when I look at my grout.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been attacked by sea monsters, and hurled into the deep by an ungrateful crew, but at last, my nautical adventure comes to a happy ending, as I&amp;rsquo;ve washed up on this Tropical island.
Now to enjoy a few tasty beers among the palm trees with my little parrot buddy Iago.

      <description>Today‚Äôs the first day I fancied a drink, which had led to a somewhat worrying development.
To keep me occupied, I have now replaced having a relaxing glass of wine with DIY. Today we have had a light fitted, ripped down a ceiling and it‚Äôs now 11pm and I‚Äôm removing all the grout from the bathroom tiles.
Is this healthy? Where will this end?
Will we survive?!!!!
Also my feet hurt, my hand is black And I have a significant amount of plaster in my hair and tit region.</description>

      <description>Gather round and listen to this tale of treachery upon the high seas.
It seems my shipmates took offence to my language yesterday, in the middle of the night those mutinous dogs dragged me from my bunk and tossed me overboard.
I managed to save myself from Davey Jones&amp;rsquo; locker by lashing a raft together from some driftwood, but now I&amp;rsquo;m a castaway, adrift upon the Big Sea.</description>

Fuck! You! With a fucking anchor! You&amp;rsquo;re all cunts so fuck you all!
Alestorm - Fucked with an anchor
Stretching the theme a little bit for the 5th of Drinktober, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the opportunity to combine three of my favourite things. Pirate costumes, heavy metal and gratuitous swearing!

      <description>I‚Äôve survived a challenge!
Most of you people know I‚Äôm a little&amp;hellip;.. funny. I‚Äôm quite OCD and if things aren‚Äôt right or tidy, expect a breakdown. I‚Äôm also an emotional drinker: annoyed? Have a brandy. Happy? Have a champers. Stressed? Vat of wine and an absolut chaser.
So yesterday I didn‚Äôt manage a post, but I did have half my kitchen ceiling down fixing a leaking lead pipe, plaster all over, half my bathroom taken out and no electric due to my dodge lighting.</description>

      <description>For the 4th of Drinktober we step into the ring with the mighty El Loco - the most feared luchador in all of East Yorkshire!
Undefeated in every match, this fearsome hero of the ring strikes terror into the hearts of his opponents, and loves nothing more than to celebrate a successful match with a victory beer!</description>

      <description>Ok day three, whatcha got?
Well we all know I‚Äôm a prolific stress drinker. So today I had a small paddy that my house is essentially falling down, nothing works and my pipes (Which are leaking) are made of lead (apparently this is bad). So I realllllly fancied some wine, or 9 double vodkas of something .
However, I‚Äôve stayed strong and drank water all goddamn day. Which is slightly less appealing to drink when it‚Äôs slowly dripping from your ceiling.</description>

      <description>Beer. Beer never changes.
When the old world fell, only a few survived. Roaming the blacktop between the remnants of the cities, scavenging for the last remaining booze of a lost civilisation.
A drop of ale in the wasteland can help keep a man sane - because if you don&amp;rsquo;t keep your head&amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;re nothing but Roadkill&amp;hellip;
Things are going a little bit post-apocalyptic for the 3rd of Drinktober as I take to the roads of the blasted wasteland that was once Yorkshire in search of more beer.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to Drinktober 2020 - we&amp;rsquo;re having a lock-in! Or a lockdown! Hopefully not getting locked up&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;m not the type to let a little thing like a global pandemic, or impending political and economic collapse get in the way of a good time, so Drinktober 2020 is going ahead as scheduled.
I&amp;rsquo;ve got an exciting range of beers lined up thanks to the excellent chaps at Beer Bandits, conveniently located just down the road from me, and lots of extremely silly antics planned, so watch this space and ready your wallets for the biggest Drinktober yet!</description>
