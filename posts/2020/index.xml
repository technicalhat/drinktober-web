      <description>Beer. Beer never changes.
When the old world fell, only a few survived. Roaming the blacktop between the remnants of the cities, scavenging for the last remaining booze of a lost civilisation.
A drop of ale in the wasteland can help keep a man sane - because if you don&amp;rsquo;t keep your head&amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;re nothing but Roadkill&amp;hellip;
 Things are going a little bit post-apocalyptic for the 3rd of Drinktober as I take to the roads of the blasted wasteland that was once Yorkshire in search of more beer.</description>

      <description>A fairly quiet one for the second of Drinktober. I&amp;rsquo;m hard at work in the Beercave prepping for the insanity to come, just taking a break to enjoy a tasty Rudgate Pale.
Tune in tomorrow, same beer time, same beer channel, when we start to kick things up a notch!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the first of Drinktober, and I should be working hard on getting everything set up for this year&amp;rsquo;s shenanigans, but instead here I am just chilling in my hammock with a nice cold lager.
I guess I&amp;rsquo;m just a Lazy Boy ;)</description>

      <description>Welcome back to Drinktober 2020 - we&amp;rsquo;re having a lock-in! Or a lockdown! Hopefully not getting locked up&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;m not the type to let a little thing like a global pandemic, or impending political and economic collapse get in the way of a good time, so Drinktober 2020 is going ahead as scheduled.
I&amp;rsquo;ve got an exciting range of beers lined up thanks to the excellent chaps at Beer Bandits, conveniently located just down the road from me, and lots of extremely silly antics planned, so watch this space and ready your wallets for the biggest Drinktober yet!</description>
