      <description>For the first beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman gave to me, a White Christmas ale from Saltaire brewery.

Merry Christmas, ya cock-a-roaches!</description>

So when she mentioned raising funds for their 2021 event I jumped at the opportunity to drink beer and show off :)</description>
