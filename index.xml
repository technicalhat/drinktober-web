Some call me the Gangster of Love

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m taking a break from it all in my cabin in the woods, but would you believe it? The ring pulls on all the beer I brought with me have snapped off, leaving me unable to open them!!
Luckily I came prepared - I just need to introduce the cans to my Axe Edge!</description>

      <description>If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing we love here at Drinktober, it&amp;rsquo;s shamelessly reusing the same prop twice and calling it a storyline :)
I thought I&amp;rsquo;d finally fought off the invaders, but this last one turned out to be too much for me to handle.
Now my only chance to survive is if I can Escape the Mothership!</description>

      <description>Another day, more water and Heineken Zero! I also appear to have replaced vino with food considering the amount of carvery I‚Äôve put away today.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had a weekend of sleep, reading and revelations being by myself and sober. Some of my closer people know this has been a bit of a mad year for me with a lot of anxiety and change, but apparently it appears that I actually quite enjoy being by myself and I don‚Äôt need anyone to meet my needs or look after me.</description>

      <description>Day 2! üí™
Fiyero (AKA Mr Fifi) is enthralled by this new beer which doesnt make mother fall over.
A day of crazy pirate mini golfing was cancelled due to me a) still being sick af and b) the usual rain of the North. So instead of hitting the pub with my homies, I have scrubbed a floor, eaten lasagne with my neighbours, eaten the worlds hottest noodles (TM) and stayed off the booze!</description>

      <description>Look at that artistic photo! The colour, the style, the Asthetic! üì∏
Some of you might know this has been a bit of a mad year for me, certainly not one I was expecting, and one I have certainly hit the bar amongst other things pretty bloody hard. So this year will probably be my biggest challenge yet.
Kicking it off today is this flirty little Heineken 0.0 delight, served with a bloody amazing steak sandwich at my favourite establishment The Punch Hotel.</description>

      <description>Droogies, boozers, strumpets and losers! Welcome once more to the booziest charity event of the year : Drinktober!
It&amp;rsquo;s been a loooooong year, but we&amp;rsquo;ve made it this far and it&amp;rsquo;s time to have some fun (well, it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to have some fun. Poor Heidi gets to spend a month on the wagon while I muck about and have a laugh.)
This year we&amp;rsquo;re going even bigger and even better, with more beers, sillier antics, and a bumper crop of poor-quality cosplay, so watch this space and get ready to chuck some cash in the pot and make all this nonsense worthwhile!</description>

And so the twelve beers of Christmas comes to an end - I hope it&amp;rsquo;s been as much fun for you guys as it has for me. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to hit the donate button on your way out!</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re almost at the end now, so it seems like a good time to celebrate with this famous festive special from the kebab shop - D√∂ner and Blitzen :D</description>

      <description>For the tenth day of Drinkmas, the Beerman brought to me : My Little Sabrony from Arbor Ales
It&amp;rsquo;s been a tough old year, a bit of a &amp;lsquo;mare. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s tricky to stay stable. A little horsing around once in a while can help save you from _foal_ing apart at the seams.
If you&amp;rsquo;re still reading after those dreadful horse puns, why not hoof it over to the donation page and drop a few quid in the box?</description>

      <description>For the ninth beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman brought to me : Pricky Back Otchan from Great Newsome Brewery
According to the label, the Pricky Back Otchan is the old Yorkshire name for a hedgehog, so naturally I had to bring out superstar hedgehog Princess Neville to take her turn in the spotlight.</description>

      <description>For the eighth beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman brought to me : Off Tempo Milkshake IPA from Bad Co. brewing
Normally this milkshake IPA would bring all the boys to the yard, but due to social distancing it&amp;rsquo;s running online milkshake classes instead.
A shiny no-prize goes to the first person to identify all the &amp;ldquo;boys&amp;rdquo; on the zoom call&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>For the seventh beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman brought to me : Easy Now Baby NEIPA from Bad Co. Brewing
It&amp;rsquo;s the eighth day of Drinkmas - New Beer&amp;rsquo;s Eve - and I&amp;rsquo;m stretching the theme to it&amp;rsquo;s limits in a flagrant case of wanting an excuse to make a costume. Baby IPA, Baby Yoda - close enough, right!

That&amp;rsquo;s right, the Christmas Kitty has come to visit - that well known festive tradition that we all know about. Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a deleted scene from the Cats movie?
Either way - meow!</description>

      <description>For the fifth beer of Drinkmas, the Beerman brought to me : Jingle Bell Rock golden ale from Pennine Brewing Co.
So occasionally when people see the Beercave Christmas decorations they ask &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s with the large paper boulder with the bells glued to it?&amp;rdquo;
So I tell them : &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s the Jingle Bell Rock!&amp;rdquo;</description>

 He sees you when you&amp;rsquo;re sleeping
He&amp;rsquo;s watching from his shelf
He wants to cut you inside out
So beware the Evil Elf!
 Yes, here to spread a little Christmas fear, it&amp;rsquo;s the evil elf. He&amp;rsquo;s off the shelf, off the chain, and out for blood.</description>

So it looks like I was one present short yesterday, and now I know why! I found this cheeky little character sitting on his shelf&amp;hellip; and he&amp;rsquo;s nicked my beer!
That&amp;rsquo;s what I call a Bad Elf!</description>

      <description>Well, here we are again, back between the bottle and the glue gun for a festive Drinktober special edition.
When Heidi&amp;rsquo;s not engaged in alcohol free antics, she also rules over Hull LGBT+ Community Pride, AKA Pride in Hull with her tiny iron fist - or something along those lines anyway! So when she mentioned raising funds for their 2021 event I jumped at the opportunity to drink beer and show off :)</description>

      <description>So, that&amp;rsquo;s about it for Drinktober 2020 then. I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you guys, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of fun. I&amp;rsquo;m already starting to plot next year&amp;rsquo;s antics, I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to pull out quite a few stops if I want to top this one!
As always, the donation site will be open for a while yet, so if you&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to chuck something in the pot and haven&amp;rsquo;t got around to it yet there&amp;rsquo;s still time.</description>

      <description>IT üëè IS üëè DONE üëè
I waited until 12 to have a prosecco&amp;hellip;..but after 2 glasses I‚Äôm done, I don‚Äôt even want to get lashed!
Possibly the weirdest DrinkTober yet, with covid and a new lockdown as of today, but I‚Äôm actually feeling quite good. This is the year I‚Äôve actually enjoyed the break and felt more comfortable to not drink. Im proud of myself and feeling quite grown up.</description>

As for me, I&amp;rsquo;m going to enjoy a nice quiet drink outdoors - in the Garden of Death!</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs so bloody close!!
one more day to go. I was initially not looking forward to this October, but I‚Äôve surprisingly enjoyed it in a funny way. Covid times are weird, so getting out walking and away from boredom drinking In front of the telly has been great (Although no walking for me for a few days due to getting a massive tattoo on my foot Yesterday!)
Overall I‚Äôm looking forward to a little drink when I finish, but I‚Äôm proud of myself.</description>

      <description>I like a southern comfort or a brandy on the rocks, even a cheeky gin ting too. Yesterday I was on different rocks!
Apparently when I don‚Äôt spend my sundays in the pub or cleaning, I enjoy outdoors now. Even getting muddy and climbing up waterfalls, j loved it! I‚Äôm even considering buying walking boots, what‚Äôs that all about? The none drinking has helped me go out and explore and actually move which I am enjoying.</description>

As you can see, things got away from me during the first test - my beer drifted away, torn from my hands by the Wild Gravity!

      <description>Where the hell has October gone?! A week and a day to go until normality can resume. Today was manic and I didn‚Äôt atop, but I didn‚Äôt actually think about having a drink, even though I had a night to myself when I‚Äôd usually treat myself. That‚Äôs personal growth right there lads!
We‚Äôve not had many donations this year, despite Johnny making it the highest class DrinkTober yet. So thank you to those that have donated, and the rest of you get your hands in your pockets!</description>

I also resisted fish and chips, my only greater love than wine, so I‚Äôm chuffed I managed that despite being up at 6 with my dad been taken to a&amp;amp;e and work all day.</description>

Frustrating day of stupid Expensive internet Dropping out and losing my work, followed by a 2 hour rowing with a smart plug which wouldn‚Äôt work and I would probably kill your nan for a drink about now.</description>

So I am currently very itchy, a bit nauseous, and with a headache from 11 and a half hours on zoom meeting, and a little drink would be bloody fantastic.</description>

I can&amp;rsquo;t get enough, I can&amp;rsquo;t get my fill
I shoot to thrill, play to kill
Yeah, pull the trigger

 Tonight I&amp;rsquo;m crashing the stage with rock legends AC/DC to fire my Big Gun.</description>

      <description>My name is Citrus Maxima. Commander of the armies of the Hops. General of the zesty Legions, loyal servant of the brew Emperor.
Drinker of a finished pint, holder of an empty glass.
And I will have my beer, in this pub or the next!
 Stepping back in time for the 10th of Drinktober, to the days of Ancient Rome, where the mighty gladiator Citrus Maxima conquered the arena and toppled an empire.</description>

      <description>I am back! Didn‚Äôt post yesterday because I managed to lock myself out of the website: something that‚Äôs a common occurrence when drunk but I‚Äôm not sure how I managed it sober.
10 whole days in and I‚Äôve lost 10lbs which is rather nice. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve saved money because my house is falling down but still, I‚Äôll take it! Today as oppose to my usual leisurely walk to the pub (the extent of my normal walking) I went on an actual solo wander which ended up being quite a treck through a housing estate, a tiny forest, some nice hills and some ropey garages.</description>

Space Dementia, Evil Scarecrow
 I&amp;rsquo;ve been blasted into the deep space for the 9th of Drinktober, courtesy of Arbor Ales&#39; Space Hardware.
I think the isolation has sent me a bit funny - am I really seeing Neville the space hedgehog or has my mind succumbed to Space Dementia?</description>

Now to enjoy a few tasty beers among the palm trees with my little parrot buddy Iago.

      <description>Today‚Äôs the first day I fancied a drink, which had led to a somewhat worrying development.
To keep me occupied, I have now replaced having a relaxing glass of wine with DIY. Today we have had a light fitted, ripped down a ceiling and it‚Äôs now 11pm and I‚Äôm removing all the grout from the bathroom tiles.
Is this healthy? Where will this end?
Will we survive?!!!!
Also my feet hurt, my hand is black And I have a significant amount of plaster in my hair and tit region.</description>

      <description>Gather round and listen to this tale of treachery upon the high seas.
It seems my shipmates took offence to my language yesterday, in the middle of the night those mutinous dogs dragged me from my bunk and tossed me overboard.
I managed to save myself from Davey Jones&#39; locker by lashing a raft together from some driftwood, but now I&amp;rsquo;m a castaway, adrift upon the Big Sea.</description>

Alestorm - Fucked with an anchor
 Stretching the theme a little bit for the 5th of Drinktober, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the opportunity to combine three of my favourite things. Pirate costumes, heavy metal and gratuitous swearing!

      <description>I‚Äôve survived a challenge!
Most of you people know I‚Äôm a little&amp;hellip;.. funny. I‚Äôm quite OCD and if things aren‚Äôt right or tidy, expect a breakdown. I‚Äôm also an emotional drinker: annoyed? Have a brandy. Happy? Have a champers. Stressed? Vat of wine and an absolut chaser.
So yesterday I didn‚Äôt manage a post, but I did have half my kitchen ceiling down fixing a leaking lead pipe, plaster all over, half my bathroom taken out and no electric due to my dodge lighting.</description>

      <description>For the 4th of Drinktober we step into the ring with the mighty El Loco - the most feared luchador in all of East Yorkshire!
Undefeated in every match, this fearsome hero of the ring strikes terror into the hearts of his opponents, and loves nothing more than to celebrate a successful match with a victory beer!</description>

      <description>Ok day three, whatcha got?
Well we all know I‚Äôm a prolific stress drinker. So today I had a small paddy that my house is essentially falling down, nothing works and my pipes (Which are leaking) are made of lead (apparently this is bad). So I realllllly fancied some wine, or 9 double vodkas of something .
However, I‚Äôve stayed strong and drank water all goddamn day. Which is slightly less appealing to drink when it‚Äôs slowly dripping from your ceiling.</description>

      <description>Beer. Beer never changes.
When the old world fell, only a few survived. Roaming the blacktop between the remnants of the cities, scavenging for the last remaining booze of a lost civilisation.
A drop of ale in the wasteland can help keep a man sane - because if you don&amp;rsquo;t keep your head&amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;re nothing but Roadkill&amp;hellip;
 Things are going a little bit post-apocalyptic for the 3rd of Drinktober as I take to the roads of the blasted wasteland that was once Yorkshire in search of more beer.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to Drinktober 2020 - we&amp;rsquo;re having a lock-in! Or a lockdown! Hopefully not getting locked up&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;m not the type to let a little thing like a global pandemic, or impending political and economic collapse get in the way of a good time, so Drinktober 2020 is going ahead as scheduled.
I&amp;rsquo;ve got an exciting range of beers lined up thanks to the excellent chaps at Beer Bandits, conveniently located just down the road from me, and lots of extremely silly antics planned, so watch this space and ready your wallets for the biggest Drinktober yet!</description>

      <description>So there we have it, folks. Another year of #Drinktober comes to a close, and we absolutely smashed it this time around.
Donations are currently sitting at 110% of the fundraising target, Heidi&amp;rsquo;s swanned off to Tenerife to drink her body weight in Prosecco, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to sign off until we come back even bigger and better for Drinktober 2020!

      <description>Well, it‚Äôs done!! And what a bloody month. Here‚Äôs what I learned:
  I don‚Äôt need alcohol, but I DO have the most stressful life and I don‚Äôt take enough time out. The past 2 weeks at work were hard. Not having a drink made me realise my job can be emotionally draining. I have little time for myself and I take on too much without thinking about unwinding in a better way.</description>

The batman (I meant barman but autocorrect knows best) recommended an Alcohol Free Kopperberg. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just like the real thing! You can‚Äôt even tell the difference!‚Äù I was assured. Not a cider drinker but I thought give it a bash.</description>

Still alcohol free and I‚Äôve developed a new love for good old water. Managed to stay off the quorn today and had a nice Sunday dinner feat. nut roast. I have however replaced my wine habit with a spending habit: I‚Äôve bought a painting, another lamp, a hat, a magnetic eyelash set, a kaftan, a pigeon pin badge and a gift for the missus already this weekend (the last ones a secret.</description>

      <description>Habits are funny aren‚Äôt they! 5 days in and I‚Äôve lost count of the number of times I‚Äôve thought ‚Äúoh I‚Äôll just grab a coke‚Äù or wandered aimlessly to the wine aisle and spent ¬£15 before I‚Äôve even thought about if I actually want it!
Today was chilled with the wife and I‚Äôve smashed in a decent homemade Quorn Lasagne. I now own 48% shares in Quorn FYI. My skin is also looking much brighter, although I do smash a load of acid on my face every night because 30‚Äôs, so it could also be that.</description>

I went out for work drinks this evening and had (drum roll please!) a J20 and a virgin cocktail&amp;hellip;. Which was nice but called ‚Äòthe love island‚Äô so minus 3 points. I also spent a hideous amount on experimental quorn and nutroasts in Lidl. I‚Äôm currently sipping cranberry juice out of a wine glass so I can express my inner Friday Heidi.</description>

      <description>Drinktober It‚Äôs all about raising money for a very good cause ‚Äì Macmillan Cancer Support.
Macmillan provide physical, financial and emotional support to people with cancer to help them live life as fully as possible. It‚Äôs a fantastic charity and the help and support means a lot to many people.
So, for the fourth year in a row, absolute leg-end superstar Heidi is going to pass on the prosecco, say nein to the wine and just giving up any and all alcohol for a gruelling 31 days.</description>
