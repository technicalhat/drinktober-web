      <description>I really fancy a booze tbh. I’ve had a bastardo of a day, I’ve not stopped and I’m still on the grouting mission so everything hurts and I would put my face through a window for a little vat of wine. I could drink it in the bath when I look at my grout.
send help.</description>

      <description>Today’s the first day I fancied a drink, which had led to a somewhat worrying development.
To keep me occupied, I have now replaced having a relaxing glass of wine with DIY. Today we have had a light fitted, ripped down a ceiling and it’s now 11pm and I’m removing all the grout from the bathroom tiles.
Is this healthy? Where will this end?
Will we survive?!!!!
Also my feet hurt, my hand is black And I have a significant amount of plaster in my hair and tit region.</description>

      <description>I’ve survived a challenge!
Most of you people know I’m a little&amp;hellip;.. funny. I’m quite OCD and if things aren’t right or tidy, expect a breakdown. I’m also an emotional drinker: annoyed? Have a brandy. Happy? Have a champers. Stressed? Vat of wine and an absolut chaser.
So yesterday I didn’t manage a post, but I did have half my kitchen ceiling down fixing a leaking lead pipe, plaster all over, half my bathroom taken out and no electric due to my dodge lighting.</description>
