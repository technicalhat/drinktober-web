      <description>Sooooooo tired and I have no energy! Went to give blood Today and it’s the first time it’s not been a great excuse to get drunk quicker! Overall I’m feeling better not drinking but I’m struggling to stay awake tonight: I reckon one vodka would currently knock me out anyway so I guess Viva le Sober!
Also on the subject of unconventional tattoos&amp;hellip;. I’ve booked one with all the money I saved not drinking 😂</description>

      <description>Hola! Works been stressful and last night I struggled a lot to not drink.
Butttttt, today I got weighed and I’ve lost 6lbs, taking my total to 16lbs which made me feel better! Went walking and managed 8.2 miles today, meaning I don’t fancy a drink at all tonight!
Please take a moment to donate if you can, my legs might drop off from today’s wandering so a cheeky fiver whilst I’m infirm would be 👌</description>

      <description>Jesus Christ I wanted a drink tonight!! I could on practically taste it. I spent a moment gazing at the prosecco at my corner shop waving my bank card and probably looked a bit not ok.
Frustrating day of stupid Expensive internet Dropping out and losing my work, followed by a 2 hour rowing with a smart plug which wouldn’t work and I would probably kill your nan for a drink about now.</description>

      <description>Well, that was a few days. Sent to work from home because I’ve developed a bizarre hives like rash type affair EVERYWHERE&amp;hellip;.. which apparently is a covid sign. Also, I’ve developed random sporadic vomiting today, WITHOUT EVEN HAVING AN ALCOHOL. Wtf?!!
So I am currently very itchy, a bit nauseous, and with a headache from 11 and a half hours on zoom meeting, and a little drink would be bloody fantastic.</description>
