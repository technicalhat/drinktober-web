      <description>Ordinarily I would be full of wine about now and shouting at the TV, but after a lazy napping day, all I‚Äôve done is drink water (I‚Äôm now so hydrated I am part dolphin) and make this fantastic roast.
Yesterday myself and the esteemed Jonathan had some fun and high jinx, with some images that will blow your mind! Plans are already underway for next year‚Ä¶..
Don‚Äôt forget that behind all Johnnys hard work, incredible costume wizardry and my sobriety, this is all for an excellent cause: supporting Macmillan who were very supportive in my cousins cancer victory.</description>

      <description>Well it&amp;rsquo;s been a strange day.
After seeing this weird white rabbit in a waistcoat out in the bottom field I followed him down a hole and now I&amp;rsquo;m trapped in a strange psychedelic land with no way home.
Still, at least I&amp;rsquo;ve found something to drink!</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to Fridays edition of #whatidowithoutthepub. What did I do without the pub? Well, er‚Ä¶. I went to work, had my covid and flu boosters, ate Moroccan food‚Ä¶ nothing very exciting really!
So let‚Äôs talk politics: specifically the Daily Star race between a wet lettuce and our recently departed PM (I‚Äôve literally had longer drinking sessions than her term).
I‚Äôve always loved the lettuce ü•¨ so of course, it has my backing.</description>

      <description>The year is 2023. As society collapses, the walled city of York becomes a futuristic prison. When terrorists hijack a truck full of beer and crash it through the city walls, only one man is tough enough to go in after it.

      <description>What do you call a reluctant potato? A hesitater.
I would likely have a small tipple after a late night at work with very little hesitation usually. However, it‚Äôs still #drinktober so alternatives must be found. In todays #whatidowithoutthepub, the only solution seemed to be cooking a shed load of food. Steamed salmon, stuffed sweet potatoes the lot in fact.
Sooner or tater I can can return to the pub, but for now this was pretty s-mash-ing!</description>

      <description>Today I VERY MUCH fancied a little beverag√©o‚Ä¶.. like I could have happily murdered for a small pint of wine. Still, todays #whatidowithoutthepub I decided to be productive so I cooked some Asian food, cleaned, and did my first ever 5km on an exercise bike.
I mean it‚Äôs not exactly a marathon but I‚Äôm wheelie pleased with myself, I‚Äôve even supplemented cranberry juice in a wine glass. Who even am I?</description>

      <description>I wish I could walk into a bar like, but in todays edition of #whatidowithoutthepub, I decided to take a nice leisurely long stroll to forget about how much I like wine.
Followed by a fairly good steak dinner, I wasn‚Äôt thinking about the end of October (which is a mere 15 days, 2 hours and 1 minute away) at all. Honest.</description>

      <description>Beer. Beer never changes.
It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the world as we know it, but luckily for me the Vault is well stocked with cans, and if there&amp;rsquo;s one thing that&amp;rsquo;s never in short supply around here it&amp;rsquo;s bottle caps!</description>

Life in the Empire isn&amp;rsquo;t all about blowing up planets and subjugating Rebel scum. Sometimes you need to wind down and take a minute for an Imperial Biscotti Break</description>

      <description>Now wait one minute‚Ä¶. Why does Johnny get to have both all the beers and all the dressing up fun?!!
Todays edition of #whatidowithoutthepub seemed a little boring once again, I‚Äôve done lots of work and housing today but not many sober adventures aside from Asda pharmacy. So please witness this #drinktober Princess Leia special for your viewing pleasure.

Today I am once again hopped up on water and black coffee, and #whatidowithoutthepub turns out to be work all day. However, to cheer my sober self up Let‚Äôs take a moment to appreciate my ridiculous homemade tortilla nachos which I think we can all agree are fairly impressive!</description>

This weekend edition of #whatidowithoutthepub includes decorating a table (yes, I‚Äôm THAT homosexual I decorated the table, see what you have done to me), responding to the incessant letters we seem to get from local religious groups and moving furniture for my adopted Mum. I also did a nice movie in bed evening with the boy and the cat, which was wholesome af as you can imagine.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a tough life being a cyborg cop. When you get done with a hard day of cleaning up the mean streets of Old Detroit, there&amp;rsquo;s still the grocery shopping to be done.
And with that comes the irresistible lure of the SpecialBuys aisle. A chainsaw? A canoe? A complete box set of WWII documentaries?

      <description>The good news is I‚Äôm past the snot stage and onto the vomit stage! The bad news is that has left little room for comedic #whatidowithoutthepub activities, but hopefully adventures will soon resume now I can successfully roll out of bed and to the sofa.
Today‚Äôs tipple is a feisty little cranberry juice, which is actually quite nice, with a lemsip chaser. Would be extra nice with a little vodka in there but here we all are.</description>

      <description>I am down with the sickness, like the disturbed sang.
Sadly, considering I fell asleep last night and woke up at 4.30 pm today (and I‚Äôm still in bed dying now), I don‚Äôt have any comedic #whatidowithoutthepub adventures to share, because I‚Äôve just been sleeping and sick! On the plus I‚Äôve caught up on some reading and some crap bed TV, and I‚Äôm far too ill to go to the off license or open the door to londis delivery, so I am still very much sober.</description>

      <description>Good news!!! I am sober and I do not fancy a drink AT ALL!!
Bad news this is primarily due to the fact I have some sort of hideous illness, currently downing lemsip as if it‚Äôs Sauvignon Blanc and dying in bed. The cats covered in snot, I coughed so hard the Alexa asked if I was ok, and my nose is as red as a walruses nutsack.
As I die quietly in bed, sober and poorly, remember to donate to an excellent cause and if you can‚Äôt donate, can somebody please make me some sort of soup and offer a rendition of soft kitty.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re barely into the first week of Drinktober when disaster strikes.
I was planning to burn off the calories from all these beers in the gym, but somehow I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself trapped inside this insane game show.
I need to find a way to escape, but the floor is guava!</description>

      <description>After a very busy, somewhat stressful and full of flu day, ordinarily this is prime circumstances for a nice chianti and a caramel cup.
However, being a good girl observing #whatidowithoutthepub, I decided to cook a nice chicken and Caesar salad and have a vitamin water followed by a terrible film. Sadly I failed to take an appropriate photo so please enjoy the artists impression of me cooking. I also fixed the washing machine so overall sober me is a complete champ.</description>

      <description>Day three and I‚Äôm sat it‚Äôs not Cat-utday still. Or at least Friday night when I could enjoy a sweet, sweet vino.
Today was a very busy day which involved much running about and not much time to miss the pub. However, now I‚Äôm home alone, this is prime drink o‚Äôclock.
Of course, I had to distract myself and find something to fit in with #whatidowithoutthepub so I decided the only healthy thing to do was to dress up my cat.</description>

      <description>I do enjoy a big putt, although this gives a different meaning to clubbing.
In today‚Äôs edition of #whatidowithoutthepub, I very much fancied some day drinking. Possibly left Over lesbian rage. However, it‚Äôs for charity innit so I decided to distract myself with my favourite competition sport, Mini Golf.
Although it‚Äôs not as fun as drunk mini golf, I did win in a spectacular fashion and looked cute doing so, so I‚Äôll take that.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been around since the early days you might have noticed I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a Judge Dredd fanboy.
So when Northern Monk released a Thought Bubble Festival collaboration beer late last year with Jock, one of my favourite Dredd artists, you can be sure I snapped up a few cans quicker than you can say &amp;ldquo;I AM THE LAW!&amp;rdquo;, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist hanging on to one to give me a chance to break out the Judge Beerman outfit again.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs here!!!! Day #1 of the glorious return of everyone‚Äôs favourite activity #drinktober
Whilst Johnny has a lovely beer, I‚Äôve undertaken my first instalment of #whatidowithoutthepub, drinking copious Heineken Zeros at a very angry, excellent lesbian energy gig.
Side note, if you‚Äôve never heard Bizarre Fae or Delilah Bon you absolutely should. - Heidi</description>
