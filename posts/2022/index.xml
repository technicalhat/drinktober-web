      <description>Well going back to my realisation of how old I am‚Ä¶. I have once again been to golf practice. 36 cheeky holes, one bad game and a nice sober infused bottle of water with it.
That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs the whole post ü´†</description>

      <description>Right it‚Äôs getting a bit harder now. I‚Äôm past the smug ‚Äòlook I am a picture of health aren‚Äôt I saintly, it‚Äôs for charity you know‚Äô stage now and I would like several vinos. I also didn‚Äôt get chance to post again yesterday because I worked until chuff o‚Äôclock and promptly fell asleep on my furry child so apologies, please forgive me dear readers.
I‚Äôm not sure when it happened but I think I have become old.</description>

      <description>Well apparently when I‚Äôm sober I get tired like a regular person, hence I fell asleep at 9pm last night on the sofa ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Today I am once again hopped up on water and black coffee, and #whatidowithoutthepub turns out to be work all day. However, to cheer my sober self up Let‚Äôs take a moment to appreciate my ridiculous homemade tortilla nachos which I think we can all agree are fairly impressive!</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm alive! And much less snotty!! i also forgot to post yesterday because I am le imbecil√©.
This weekend edition of #whatidowithoutthepub includes decorating a table (yes, I‚Äôm THAT homosexual I decorated the table, see what you have done to me), responding to the incessant letters we seem to get from local religious groups and moving furniture for my adopted Mum. I also did a nice movie in bed evening with the boy and the cat, which was wholesome af as you can imagine.</description>

      <description>Dead or alive, you&amp;rsquo;re coming shopping.
It&amp;rsquo;s a tough life being a cyborg cop. When you get done with a hard day of cleaning up the mean streets of Old Detroit, there&amp;rsquo;s still the grocery shopping to be done.
And with that comes the irresistible lure of the SpecialBuys aisle. A chainsaw? A canoe? A complete box set of WWII documentaries?
I&amp;rsquo;d buy that for a dollar!</description>

      <description>The good news is I‚Äôm past the snot stage and onto the vomit stage! The bad news is that has left little room for comedic #whatidowithoutthepub activities, but hopefully adventures will soon resume now I can successfully roll out of bed and to the sofa.
Today‚Äôs tipple is a feisty little cranberry juice, which is actually quite nice, with a lemsip chaser. Would be extra nice with a little vodka in there but here we all are.</description>

      <description>At long last, this epic quest has finally come to an end.
I&amp;rsquo;ve followed the mysterious red line around the map, accompanied by inspiring orchestral music, for many years but now in this cave I&amp;rsquo;ve finally found the Holy Grail!
Surely this is the cup of a coder!</description>

      <description>I am down with the sickness, like the disturbed sang.
Sadly, considering I fell asleep last night and woke up at 4.30 pm today (and I‚Äôm still in bed dying now), I don‚Äôt have any comedic #whatidowithoutthepub adventures to share, because I‚Äôve just been sleeping and sick! On the plus I‚Äôve caught up on some reading and some crap bed TV, and I‚Äôm far too ill to go to the off license or open the door to londis delivery, so I am still very much sober.</description>

      <description>Good news!!! I am sober and I do not fancy a drink AT ALL!!
Bad news this is primarily due to the fact I have some sort of hideous illness, currently downing lemsip as if it‚Äôs Sauvignon Blanc and dying in bed. The cats covered in snot, I coughed so hard the Alexa asked if I was ok, and my nose is as red as a walruses nutsack.
As I die quietly in bed, sober and poorly, remember to donate to an excellent cause and if you can‚Äôt donate, can somebody please make me some sort of soup and offer a rendition of soft kitty.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re barely into the first week of Drinktober when disaster strikes.
I was planning to burn off the calories from all these beers in the gym, but somehow I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself trapped inside this insane game show.
I need to find a way to escape, but the floor is guava!</description>

      <description>After a very busy, somewhat stressful and full of flu day, ordinarily this is prime circumstances for a nice chianti and a caramel cup.
However, being a good girl observing #whatidowithoutthepub, I decided to cook a nice chicken and Caesar salad and have a vitamin water followed by a terrible film. Sadly I failed to take an appropriate photo so please enjoy the artists impression of me cooking. I also fixed the washing machine so overall sober me is a complete champ.</description>

      <description>Day three and I‚Äôm sat it‚Äôs not Cat-utday still. Or at least Friday night when I could enjoy a sweet, sweet vino.
Today was a very busy day which involved much running about and not much time to miss the pub. However, now I‚Äôm home alone, this is prime drink o‚Äôclock.
Of course, I had to distract myself and find something to fit in with #whatidowithoutthepub so I decided the only healthy thing to do was to dress up my cat.</description>

      <description>I do enjoy a big putt, although this gives a different meaning to clubbing.
In today‚Äôs edition of #whatidowithoutthepub, I very much fancied some day drinking. Possibly left Over lesbian rage. However, it‚Äôs for charity innit so I decided to distract myself with my favourite competition sport, Mini Golf.
Although it‚Äôs not as fun as drunk mini golf, I did win in a spectacular fashion and looked cute doing so, so I‚Äôll take that.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been around since the early days you might have noticed I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a Judge Dredd fanboy.
So when Northern Monk released a Thought Bubble Festival collaboration beer late last year with Jock, one of my favourite Dredd artists, you can be sure I snapped up a few cans quicker than you can say &amp;ldquo;I AM THE LAW!&amp;rdquo;, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist hanging on to one to give me a chance to break out the Judge Beerman outfit again.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs here!!!! Day #1 of the glorious return of everyone‚Äôs favourite activity #drinktober
Whilst Johnny has a lovely beer, I‚Äôve undertaken my first instalment of #whatidowithoutthepub, drinking copious Heineken Zeros at a very angry, excellent lesbian energy gig.
Side note, if you‚Äôve never heard Bizarre Fae or Delilah Bon you absolutely should. - Heidi</description>
