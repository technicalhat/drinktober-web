      <description>If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing we love here at Drinktober, it&amp;rsquo;s shamelessly reusing the same prop twice and calling it a storyline :)
I thought I&amp;rsquo;d finally fought off the invaders, but this last one turned out to be too much for me to handle.
Now my only chance to survive is if I can Escape the Mothership!</description>

      <description>Another day, more water and Heineken Zero! I also appear to have replaced vino with food considering the amount of carvery I’ve put away today.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had a weekend of sleep, reading and revelations being by myself and sober. Some of my closer people know this has been a bit of a mad year for me with a lot of anxiety and change, but apparently it appears that I actually quite enjoy being by myself and I don’t need anyone to meet my needs or look after me.</description>

      <description>Day 2! 💪
Fiyero (AKA Mr Fifi) is enthralled by this new beer which doesnt make mother fall over.
A day of crazy pirate mini golfing was cancelled due to me a) still being sick af and b) the usual rain of the North. So instead of hitting the pub with my homies, I have scrubbed a floor, eaten lasagne with my neighbours, eaten the worlds hottest noodles (TM) and stayed off the booze!</description>

      <description>Look at that artistic photo! The colour, the style, the Asthetic! 📸
Some of you might know this has been a bit of a mad year for me, certainly not one I was expecting, and one I have certainly hit the bar amongst other things pretty bloody hard. So this year will probably be my biggest challenge yet.
Kicking it off today is this flirty little Heineken 0.0 delight, served with a bloody amazing steak sandwich at my favourite establishment The Punch Hotel.</description>

      <description>Droogies, boozers, strumpets and losers! Welcome once more to the booziest charity event of the year : Drinktober!
It&amp;rsquo;s been a loooooong year, but we&amp;rsquo;ve made it this far and it&amp;rsquo;s time to have some fun (well, it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to have some fun. Poor Heidi gets to spend a month on the wagon while I muck about and have a laugh.)
This year we&amp;rsquo;re going even bigger and even better, with more beers, sillier antics, and a bumper crop of poor-quality cosplay, so watch this space and get ready to chuck some cash in the pot and make all this nonsense worthwhile!</description>
