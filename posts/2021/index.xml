      <description>And we&amp;rsquo;re off! Welcome back to another month of the booze-inspired mayhem known as Drinktober. We&amp;rsquo;ve got some absolutely phenomenal stuff coming up this year so get ready to go hammer on that donate button!
Kicking things off with a kung fu classic as I whip out my trusty beer-chucks and prepare to Enter the Dragon!</description>

      <description>Droogies, boozers, strumpets and losers! Welcome once more to the booziest charity event of the year : Drinktober!
It&amp;rsquo;s been a loooooong year, but we&amp;rsquo;ve made it this far and it&amp;rsquo;s time to have some fun (well, it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to have some fun. Poor Heidi gets to spend a month on the wagon while I muck about and have a laugh.)
This year we&amp;rsquo;re going even bigger and even better, with more beers, sillier antics, and a bumper crop of poor-quality cosplay, so watch this space and get ready to chuck some cash in the pot and make all this nonsense worthwhile!</description>
