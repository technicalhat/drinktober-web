      <description>Jesus Christ I wanted a drink tonight!! I could on practically taste it. I spent a moment gazing at the prosecco at my corner shop waving my bank card and probably looked a bit not ok.
Frustrating day of stupid Expensive internet Dropping out and losing my work, followed by a 2 hour rowing with a smart plug which wouldn’t work and I would probably kill your nan for a drink about now.</description>

      <description>Well, that was a few days. Sent to work from home because I’ve developed a bizarre hives like rash type affair EVERYWHERE&amp;hellip;.. which apparently is a covid sign. Also, I’ve developed random sporadic vomiting today, WITHOUT EVEN HAVING AN ALCOHOL. Wtf?!!
So I am currently very itchy, a bit nauseous, and with a headache from 11 and a half hours on zoom meeting, and a little drink would be bloody fantastic.</description>
