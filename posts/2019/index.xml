      <description>Have you ever eaten a vegan sausage? I have now. It was awful. Had to spit it out, think it ruined my life.
Three more weeks of this. Vegan sausage bullshit. It‚Äôs making me sad.</description>

      <description>I don‚Äôt have anything exciting to say. I‚Äôve just accepted drinking water is my life now&amp;hellip;. made a vegan sausage casserole for tomorrow nights dinner and made very nice dumplings to chuck in. Of course housemate then reminds me that they have beef dripping in, so I can‚Äôt have them. Chuffing excellent. Fml.

      <description>Today I had a late meeting again, so popped to the pub for the ultimate test. I was gaggingggggg for a drink. Any drink. Wine. Gin. Terps. I fancied one.
The batman (I meant barman but autocorrect knows best) recommended an Alcohol Free Kopperberg. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just like the real thing! You can‚Äôt even tell the difference!‚Äù I was assured. Not a cider drinker but I thought give it a bash.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve realised that this site has become more my rambling blog than anything so I‚Äôll keep it brief today! 90‚Äôs Carrie Bradshaw narration isn‚Äôt a good look for me.
Still alcohol free and I‚Äôve developed a new love for good old water. Managed to stay off the quorn today and had a nice Sunday dinner feat. nut roast. I have however replaced my wine habit with a spending habit: I‚Äôve bought a painting, another lamp, a hat, a magnetic eyelash set, a kaftan, a pigeon pin badge and a gift for the missus already this weekend (the last ones a secret.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve got a pussy!
I have a dick-ah!
So what&amp;rsquo;s the problem?
Let&amp;rsquo;s do it quiiiiick
 Pulling out all the stops for the 5th of #Drinktober, for this Rammsteiner Pilsner I actually went on tour with Rammstein and they let me ride their giant cock cannon, as you can see in the totally real and definitely not at all photoshopped picture below.</description>

      <description>Habits are funny aren‚Äôt they! 5 days in and I‚Äôve lost count of the number of times I‚Äôve thought ‚Äúoh I‚Äôll just grab a coke‚Äù or wandered aimlessly to the wine aisle and spent ¬£15 before I‚Äôve even thought about if I actually want it!
Today was chilled with the wife and I‚Äôve smashed in a decent homemade Quorn Lasagne. I now own 48% shares in Quorn FYI. My skin is also looking much brighter, although I do smash a load of acid on my face every night because 30‚Äôs, so it could also be that.</description>

      <description>Today is slightly better! Purchased some iron tablets: turned out that‚Äôs what fucked me up yesterday. An iron tablet and a multivit and I‚Äôm off.
I went out for work drinks this evening and had (drum roll please!) a J20 and a virgin cocktail&amp;hellip;. Which was nice but called ‚Äòthe love island‚Äô so minus 3 points. I also spent a hideous amount on experimental quorn and nutroasts in Lidl. I‚Äôm currently sipping cranberry juice out of a wine glass so I can express my inner Friday Heidi.</description>

      <description>Well today has kicked my arse. I‚Äôve felt absolutely crap all day: not sure if it‚Äôs lack of meat or caffeine. Shit day, sat in a meeting until 10.30 surrounded by wine and burgers&amp;hellip;. kill me now. I also had my first Ribena. What a load of shit.</description>

And you know we always will
It&amp;rsquo;s a bomber! It&amp;rsquo;s a bomber!
 A Lancaster bomber - for the 2nd of #Drinktober I&amp;rsquo;ve got this rather tasty amber ale, even if it is named for the dark lands on the Wrong side of the Pennines&amp;hellip;</description>
