      <description>Today is slightly better! Purchased some iron tablets: turned out that’s what fucked me up yesterday. An iron tablet and a multivit and I’m off.
I went out for work drinks this evening and had (drum roll please!) a J20 and a virgin cocktail&amp;hellip;. Which was nice but called ‘the love island’ so minus 3 points. I also spent a hideous amount on experimental quorn and nutroasts in Lidl. I’m currently sipping cranberry juice out of a wine glass so I can express my inner Friday Heidi.</description>

      <description>Well today has kicked my arse. I’ve felt absolutely crap all day: not sure if it’s lack of meat or caffeine. Shit day, sat in a meeting until 10.30 surrounded by wine and burgers&amp;hellip;. kill me now. I also had my first Ribena. What a load of shit.</description>

      <description>When we shoot to kill
And you know we always will
It&amp;rsquo;s a bomber! It&amp;rsquo;s a bomber!
 A Lancaster bomber - for the 2nd of #Drinktober I&amp;rsquo;ve got this rather tasty amber ale, even if it is named for the dark lands on the Wrong side of the Pennines&amp;hellip;</description>
